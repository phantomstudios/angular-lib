Package introduction, couple of paragraphs, with small code example.

import {ClipboardModule} from '@phantom/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ClipboardModule,
  ],
})
export class Foo {}
```

```

## Installation

Install this package with `npm`.

```bash
npm i @phntms/angular-lib
```

## Usage

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the
`dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). You can run the tests in watch mode if
you prefer with `ng test --watch=false`. Make sure the project is build before
running tests using `npm run build`. All tests are run in a pre-push hook
meaning you will not be able to push broken code to the repo.

### Testing locally

Build and test the project first.

```bash
npm run build

npm run test
```

From another project, link the build files as a dependency.

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-test-project

npm link ../phntms-angular-lib/dist/angular-lib/
```
